## Cheatsheet for Answer Set Programming

Uni Potsdam, winter semester 2019/20

This document contains step-by-step walkthroughs and explanations (to the best of my understanding) of the following ASP algorithms covered in class:

- The reduct *P^X*
- Clark's completion *CF(P)*
- Loop formulas *LF(P)*
- Greatest unfounded set, all unfounded sets
- Fitting semantics
- Wellfounded semantics
- Nogoods (completion and loop nogoods)
- Unit propagation
- Conflict analysis

It also contains a glossary of important concepts/notations and the answers to the quiz questions from all exercises this term (could be useful, who knows?).
