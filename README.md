This is a low-level, practically-oriented explanation of the syntax used in the ASP exercises from the class "Answer Set Programming in Practice" at the Uni Potsdam in the winter semester 2019/20. This document will be updated with new concepts throughout the semester and can then be used to help study for the exam.
